# Description of project
* I am trying to build a quiz web application for the preparation of the competitve examinations and other examination conducted by diiferent types of universities.
* Using our platform "Pre-Pulse" it becomes easier for students to start preparing for the competive examinations such as GRE, CAT mainly focusing on Verbal and Quantitative Aptitude
* There may be question arising such as "What makes your particular project a stand-out ?", We are commited on building a "Community" for the Verbal-Reasoning and Quantitative Aptitude (to begin with).
* This community will be an interface where people who has already given the competitive examination or campus placement preparation their insight s on solving the problems in the stipulated time. If any quant questions asked for them in a particular question they can share how they tackled this question.
* This type of community is most important as of there are no such communities to solve these type problems, hoping this would be the first.
* Anyone wanting to make contributions or have any ideas can ping me through my Email:- jayanthbobbili@gmail.com
